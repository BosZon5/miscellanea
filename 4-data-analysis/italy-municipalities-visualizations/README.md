# Italy Municipalities with Tableau

## Overview

Extraction and visualization through *Tableau software* of data about three *Italian administrative divisions*: regions, provinces, and municipalities. The data come from Istat website, in particular from two sources:

- [Borders of municipalities, provinces and regions](https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/222527)
- [Populations, areas and altitudes of municipalities](https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/156224)

The specific links to the data can be retrieved in the Python file. The *resulting visualizations* can be visualized on *Tableau website* following [this link](https://public.tableau.com/views/ItalymunicipalitiesfromISTATdata/Geographicview?:language=it-IT&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
