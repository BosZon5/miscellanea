```1-titanic```: analysis and prediction generation for the [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) Getting Started Competition; the *survival* of some passengers must be predicted based on some relevant features; different *classification* methods are employed with grid search;

```2-digit-recognizer```: analysis and prediction generation for the [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer) Getting Started Competition; a *deep learning* approach, featuring *convolutional neural networks*, is employed; 

```3-spaceship-titanic```: analysis and prediction generation for the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) Getting Started Competition; it features the same task of the Titanic challenge, but with an important fraction of *missing data*; thus, the script focuses on *dataset analysis* (contingency tables, countplots, histograms, etc...), that allows to *impute* many of the missing values.
